Introduction
============
The *JPRP* (Joint Patners Reporting Portal) portal is an open source solution customized to support the *PEPFAR* system on similar partner reporting system based on the `DHIS2 <https://www.dhis2.org/>`_ platform which is currently being used for health reporting in Kenya and over 32 countries worldwide

This portal replaces the KePMS reporting system for *MoH 731* and *MoH 711* forms which has been previously used for PEPFAR reporting by the implementing partners. The portal fetches data using API to API technology from the national DHIS2 government reporting system. Thus amassing partner efforts in ensuring accurate data in the national dhis2 system. JPRP portal will also lessen the burden of the data entry clerks of duplicate data entry for MoH 731 and MoH 711 tools to both national DHIS2 and KePMS. Data is attributed to IPs and Funding agencies on import so and this facilitates partner and funding for the packing for *PEPFAR*.

Why JPRP?
---------
JPRP portal comes with the following benefits:

1.To avoid double data entry to KePMS and the `National DHIS2 <https://hiskenya.org/>`_ by fetching the entered National DHIS2 via the API.

2.To perform attribution on the unattributed fetched DHIS2 data basing on Partner data element ownership for program level data consumption in decision making.

3.To enhance the National DHIS2 data by pulling efforts of all implementing partners in making sure that the data
entered into the national DHIS2 is accurate.

4.The JPRP portal is  streamlines health data where all partners can access up to date data from the same database instance unlike the previous scenario where each partner was running their own KePMS instances.

5.The portal provides aggregated data for programs per sites implementing partners , Implementing agencies and Donor levels.

6.The portal provides a cumulative data element functionality currently not being provided by the DHIS2 platform on which it is based on.
